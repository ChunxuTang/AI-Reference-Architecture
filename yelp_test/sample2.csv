The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting.

From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!","2012-01-03 15:28:18"

I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.

The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.","2016-05-31 02:14:54"

WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.","2008-12-03 04:13:43"

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...
- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. 
- Clean the bathroom!!

Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.","2017-01-02 04:12:17"

In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.","2012-05-29 03:51:08"

At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada.

No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. 

My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.

To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. 

Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people.

Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. 

But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. 

Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.","2012-03-30 20:57:29"

   I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the ""loud"" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.
   Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.","2012-06-26 02:49:39"

The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this

    Roast Beef

    Roast Pork
    Roast Pork Combo
    Baked Ham
    Baked Ham Combo
    Roast Turkey
    Roast Turkey Combo
    Broccoli Rabe

No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)

The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  

When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.

I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.

The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.","2014-11-12 12:41:29"

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.","2013-08-03 16:26:48"

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave.

Their staff was always professional and their expertise was obvious. The day of the event, they created such a gorgeous space with all the beautiful arrangements - our guests raved about them, even days after the event was over! I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.

The black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. 

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. 

This entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. 

No one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled.

Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long.

He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.

My friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said ""look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days."" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.

Allison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.

One of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

The restaurant doesn't have great seating  in the store, so I will take food to go next time. The owner served us and he was very nice, but I don't think people eat in the restaurant very often.

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign. 

Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better.

It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is.

- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.
-Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. 
- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. 
- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. 
-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. 
-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa!

-They have a few modern pieces.

The car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th), and still, I was still charged for underage fee, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.

The last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.

I will never get tired of raving about our experience.  We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!

The hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!

The rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!

The brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! 

Finally, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander.  Nick and Will treated us like their own family.  They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable.  Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block.  The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating.  They take great pride in ensuring that every guest has a wonderful experience.  We just adore everyone there!  I absolutely loved working with them and would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone!","2014-03-14 16:57:14"

I liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.

Another taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.

I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.

I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  

The egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.

The pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.

The server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.

They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts).

The bathrooms are fantastic and for the men fully stocked with shavers, shaving cream and lotions.   You need absolutely no toiletries all provided.  Great location next to the mall.

But since we were already there, might as well suck it up and see what's it all about. We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice.","2013-03-18 21:33:19"

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut","2013-07-12 20:44:45"

I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids.

A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   

So go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.","2011-08-25 16:14:24"

Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell.

I rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. 

We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.

It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. 

After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). 

After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. 

Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. 

They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...

In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. 

I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.","2017-09-09 00:09:15"

Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  

Tahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  

My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.","2013-08-03 15:34:15"

My sister was visiting for the weekend, so I wanted to show her a solid night on the town that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. 
Deciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:

Friends ""Let's go to FMs"" 
Me: ""No, too much broken glass""
Friends: ""Let's go to Snake and Jake's""
Me: ""Eh....""
Friends: ""Brothers 3?""
Me: ""I'm afraid I'll hit my head on the ceiling""
Friends: ""The Saint!!""
Me: ""I suppose I haven't been there before, I'm curious.""

After entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I'm glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night.

On my travels, I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year, I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example, Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.

Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T, I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.

I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all.","2015-04-01 15:45:29"

Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires.

The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages.

 Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that.

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. 

The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. 

Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. 

Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. 

All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. 

We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet).

The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

On a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.

The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.

The burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. 

Another unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. 

The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done.

You won't miss the meat

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.","2012-08-15 19:17:49"

They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.

I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. 

After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. 

After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"". 

Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.","2014-05-08 13:41:39"

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.","2013-11-14 01:23:03"

And now for a full review:

I have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.

On my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.

Being out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.

The interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.

Our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.

For dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.

Complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). 

Overall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: 

1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.

2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.

When we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.

All in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.","2012-07-16 17:27:36"

I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. 

Our server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. 

The crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well.

In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.

Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  

Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said ""I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!""  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  

I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.","2014-05-26 17:53:55"

It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.

Wish we had one this good near us in upper PA. Person that rang us in was friendly and helpful. Two things  made our experience top notch. First was out waiter Eric, who was friendly, observant, went out of his way to get odd requests, and quick to getting back to us.  Eric is the type of waiter you would find a quality sit down restaurant.  The other were the 2 people at the grill house station. When I asked to have shrimp not basted due to a pepper allergy that offered to get different tings to remove them from the grill. I appreciated their thoughtfulness.","2017-12-30 00:59:20"

It is just across the street from 30th Street Station, and just down the street from Drexel University.  We we able to get street parking about 2 blocks down the street, so that is always a plus.  

Service was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.","2009-10-13 23:05:04"

We got there at 8 and there was no line (by the time we left at around 11 there was a line down the street). The cover band is awesome. There were at least 10 other bachelorette groups there and a few 50th birthday parties too. Their signature cocktails are great but overpriced in my opinion. I would go back though for another bachelorette party or birthday. Probably wouldn't try if it was any regular night out. Gets very crowded.","2016-04-11 17:33:05"

Anyhow, I came during university city restaurant week and will never return. We sat outside and there were kids playing football right near the tables and being loud. We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress.","2016-08-25 18:34:30"
